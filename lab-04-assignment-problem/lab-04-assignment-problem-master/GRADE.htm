Dear Student,

I'm happy to announce that you've managed to get **6** out of 10 points for this assignment.\
There still exist some issues that should be addressed before the deadline (2022-05-11 09:30:00 GMT). For further details, please refer to the following list:

<details><summary>Should find partial assignment in cost matrix &gt;&gt; partial assignment is incorrect:</summary>- got: {0: 3, 1: 0, 3: 1}<br>- expected: {0: 3, 1: 2, 3: 0}<br>- for cost matrix: <br>    [[1 8 1 0]<br>     [0 5 0 1]<br>     [6 2 4 0]<br>     [0 0 4 2]]<br>tip. remember that smaller index wins ties</details>
<details><summary>Should perform crossing algorithm on cost matrix &gt;&gt; crossing algorithm is not performed properly:</summary>- got: <br>    [[0 9 0 4]<br>     [0 7 6 1]<br>     [2 0 0 0]<br>     [0 3 5 3]]<br>- expected: <br>    [[1 9 0 4]<br>     [0 6 5 0]<br>     [3 0 0 0]<br>     [0 2 4 2]]<br>- for cost matrix: <br>    [[0 9 0 4]<br>     [0 7 6 1]<br>     [2 0 0 0]<br>     [0 3 5 3]]<br>- and partial assignment: {1: 0, 0: 2, 2: 1}</details>
